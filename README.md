# RecyclerView-API
This program incorporates a RecyclerView that displays data fetched from an API in the form of a list.
The RecyclerView efficiently manages the display of large datasets by recycling views as the user scrolls.
By retrieving data from the API, the program ensures that the RecyclerView is populated with the latest information. 
This feature enhances the user experience by presenting the data in a dynamic and interactive manner, allowing for easy navigation and exploration of the retrieved information.
